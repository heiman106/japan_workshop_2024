As genomic data from cross population studies continues to grow, it is imperative that scientists are empowered with skills to analyse these data using the latest tools and approaches for advancing research and genomics applications globally. </p> <p>This short course will equip scientists with tools and approaches for polygenic risk scores (PRS) analysis. The course will cover both applied and theoretical topics in PRS research, delivered across a variety of lectures, tutorials, computational practicals and special guest seminars from experts in the field. By the end of the workshop, attendees should have an in-depth theoretical understanding and practical skills in PRS analysis of global populations. </p> <p>The course will begin with an overview of genome-wide association studies, an introduction to PRS analysis, advanced topics in PRS (e.g., pathway-based PRS, PRS*Environment interactions, PRS to identify rare variants). This will be followed by the key topic of the \u2018PRS Portability Problem\u2019 and how to address it using PRS methods developed for application to diverse and admixed ancestry samples. Finally, attendees will devise, perform and present their own research project as part of a group on a topic relevant to the content of the course, with feedback from the workshop team. </p>"},{"location":"#target-audience","title":"Target audience","text":"<p>Students and scientists based in Japan and (other Asian countries?) interested in the theory and/or application of polygenic risk scores, important for those undertaking research in: Bioinformatics, Genetic Epidemiology, Population Genetics, Statistical Genetics, Clinical Genetics, Quantitative Genetics.</p>"},{"location":"#programme","title":"Programme","text":"<p>The course will run over 2 days and will include lectures, tutorials, computational practicals and special guest seminars from experts in the field.
