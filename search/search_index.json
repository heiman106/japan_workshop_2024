As genomic data from multi-ancestry population studies continues to grow, it is imperative that scientists are empowered with the skills to analyse these data using the latest tools and approaches for advancing research and genomics applications globally. </p> <p>This short course will train scientists with computational tools and the latest approaches required to perform polygenic risk scores (PRS) analyses. The course will cover both theoretical and applied topics in PRS research and will be delivered across a variety of tutorials, lectures and computational practicals. The course will also involve many opportunities to discuss the topics with the tutors and with other workshop participants, and so this is also a great networking opportunity. By the end of the workshop, attendees should have an in-depth theoretical understanding and practical skills in PRS analysis of global populations. </p> <p>The course will begin with a brief overview of GWAS, an introduction to PRS analysis, advanced topics in PRS (e.g., pathway-based PRS, PRS*Environment interactions, PRS to identify rare variants). This will be followed by introducing and then investigating the critically important topic of the \u2018PRS Portability Problem\u2019, in which PRS are known to generalise less well between population of different ancestry. Workshop participants will learn how to address this using the latest PRS methods developed for application to diverse and admixed ancestry samples, including PRS-CSx and BridgePRS.</p>"},{"location":"#target-audience","title":"Target audience","text":"<p>Students and scientists based inside or outside of Japan interested in the theory and/or application of polygenic risk scores, important for those undertaking research in: Bioinformatics, Genetic Epidemiology, Population Genetics, Statistical Genetics, Clinical Genetics, Quantitative Genetics.</p>"},{"location":"#programme","title":"Programme","text":"<p>The course will take place over 2 days and will include lectures, tutorials and computational practicals.
